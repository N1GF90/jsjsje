## About YT-Downloader

This Webapp provides a simple platform for users to download youtube videos.
This project is still work in progress, as of now the video download part process is pretty slow. (But it works :))

## Future upgrades

- Break the video to read in chunks, **avoids downloading the entire video into response**.
- Provide options to download videos in **different resolutions**.
